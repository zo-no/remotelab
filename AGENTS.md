## What Is RemoteLab

A web app that gives super-individuals an AI workbench for orchestrating AI work across phone and desktop. Strong executors run on the owner’s macOS/Linux machine; the human manages goals, projects, and decisions from whichever endpoint is most convenient.

**Not** a terminal emulator, a traditional editor-first IDE, or a chatbot. It's an **AI workbench / control console for human-AI collaboration** — the user sets direction, the executors do the work, and RemoteLab keeps orchestration and context coherent.

- Single owner, not multi-user
- Node.js, no external frameworks (only `ws` for WebSocket)
- Vanilla JS frontend, no build tools

## Documentation Rule

For setup, deployment, integration, and feature-activation docs, use a model-first, prompt-first shape:

- assume the operator is a human delegating to their own AI coding agent
- have the AI collect all required context in one early handoff whenever possible, instead of drip-feeding questions across many turns
- prefer one structured input packet from the human, then autonomous execution by the AI until completion or a true `[HUMAN]` checkpoint
- lead with a copyable prompt, one-round input requirements, target state, and explicit `[HUMAN]` checkpoints
- keep automatable command-by-command flow inside the AI conversation or scripts, not as a long manual cookbook
- minimize human interruption so the operator can hand off the task and come back only for approvals, browser-only actions, validation, or final handoff

## Architecture

```
Browser / app surface ──HTTPS──→ Cloudflare Tunnel ──→ chat-server.mjs (:7690)
                                                    │
                                      HTTP control plane + WS hints
                                                    │
                                      durable history + run state
                                            │
                                 detached runners normalize back to HTTP
```

### Chat Architecture

| Service | Port | Domain | Role |
|---------|------|--------|------|
| `chat-server.mjs` | **7690** | production chat domain | **Primary** — the shipped owner chat/control plane |

**Dev workflow**: use the normal `7690` service as the single chat/control plane. RemoteLab now relies on clean restart recovery rather than a separate permanent validation plane.

**Self-hosting rule**: restarting the active chat server is acceptable when needed because runs reconcile back from durable state. Treat restart as a transport interruption with logical recovery, not as a reason to maintain a second permanent chat plane. Manual extra instances remain optional ad-hoc debugging tools only. See `notes/current/self-hosting-dev-restarts.md`.

## Key Product Concepts

### Sessions
Unit of work = one chat conversation with one AI tool. Persisted across disconnects. Resume IDs (`claudeSessionId`, `codexThreadId`) stored in metadata so AI context survives server restarts.

### Apps (Templates)
Reusable AI workflows shareable via link. Each App defines: name, systemPrompt, skills, tool. When a Visitor clicks the share link → auto-creates a scoped Session with the App's system prompt injected.

### Owner / Visitor Model
- **Owner**: Full access. Logs in with token or password.
- **Visitor**: Accesses only a specific App via share link. Sees chat-only UI (no sidebar). Each Visitor gets an independent Session. This is NOT multi-user — Visitors are scoped guests.

### Session Labeling
`summarizer.mjs` now exists to suggest canonical session presentation metadata — `title`, `group`, and hidden `description` — without owning any separate Progress state. The `Progress` tab remains only as an empty UI shell reserved for future surfaces.

### Memory System (Pointer-First)
- **Storage tiers** still matter:
  - System-level (`memory/system.md` in repo): universal learnings shared across deployments
  - User-level (`~/.remotelab/memory/`): machine-specific knowledge, private
- **Activation layers** matter just as much:
  - `bootstrap.md`: tiny startup index
  - `projects.md`: project pointer catalog
  - `tasks/` and deeper docs: load only after task scope is clear
- Goal: large total memory on disk, small relevant context in-session

---

## Security

- **Token**: 256-bit random hex, timing-safe comparison
- **Password**: scrypt-hashed alternative
- **Cookies**: HttpOnly + Secure + SameSite=Strict, 24h expiry
- **Rate limiting**: Exponential backoff on login failures (max 15min)
- **Network**: Services listen on 127.0.0.1 only; external access via Cloudflare Tunnel
- **CSP**: Nonce-based script allowlist
- **Input validation**: Tool commands reject shell metacharacters

---

## Hard Constraints (Non-Negotiable)

1. **Single shipped chat plane** — keep the shipped architecture centered on the primary `7690` chat-server unless a new operator surface is explicitly reintroduced
2. **No external frameworks** — Node.js built-ins + `ws` only
3. **Restart-safe recovery** — prefer durable restart/reload recovery over maintaining a permanent second chat plane
4. **Vanilla JS frontend** — no build tools, no framework
5. **Every change = new commit** — never use `--amend`, only new commits
6. **Single Owner** — no multi-user auth infrastructure
7. **Agent-driven first** — new features prefer conversation/Skill over dedicated UI
8. **ES Modules** — `"type": "module"`, all `.mjs` files
9. **Template style** — `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` substitution, nonce-injected scripts

---

## Current Priorities

Current operating rule: prefer capability-first shipping slices that validate the target product shape before another broad refactor round. Keep refactors limited to the work directly required by those slices or to regressions they expose.

### Done (recent)
- [x] Owner/Visitor dual-role identity
- [x] App system (CRUD API, share tokens, visitor flow)
- [x] Resume ID persistence (survives server restarts)
- [x] Web push notifications

### P1 — Next Up
- [ ] Clarify the session-first owner main flow without making `Board` the planning anchor — hide or remove the current board temporarily if it constrains better interaction ideas
- [ ] Multi-session fan-out from one owner turn — let a manager/control session intentionally spawn several focused parallel sessions, keep hierarchy light, and rely on concise aggregation plus session-level navigation rather than heavy parent-side handoff UI
- [ ] Cross-session context freshness — let a new or sibling session pick up recent relevant context from adjacent work without requiring the user to restate everything, while keeping imports bounded and inspectable
- [ ] Context carry/cache confirmation — validate and tune compaction, prepared fork context, summary/refs reuse, and any cross-session handoff packet so session-first multi-session flows stay fast and bounded
- [ ] Expose AI-controlled session presentation (`title`, `group`, `description`) via session APIs, then validate the AI-owned session-list / inbox UX before deciding whether a richer board should return
- [ ] Universal control inbox / dispatcher session — a default high-trust intake surface layered on top of the session-first + multi-session contract, not one giant always-growing work thread
- [ ] Revisit board/grouping/task-like workflow surfaces only after the main flow and cross-session context contract feel real; keep the owner-facing surface single-layer and session-first unless lived use proves otherwise
- [ ] Skills framework (file storage + loading mechanism)
- [ ] Provider registry abstraction — open model selection, local JS/JSON provider config, no more Claude/Codex-only model wiring
- [ ] Provider management UX — setup/settings should support preset enablement, simple GUI JSON providers, and advanced code mode
- [ ] Session metadata enrichment beyond presentation (`project`, `status`, `priority`, `tags`)
- [ ] Produce a precise file-level concept→implementation guide so future sessions can route directly to the right files with less repo spelunking

### P2 — Future
- [ ] Deferred triggers (AI-initiated actions, scheduled follow-ups)
- [ ] First-run onboarding App/session — on a fresh RemoteLab Live launch, seed a built-in guide App and intro session so the owner sees capabilities and suggested next actions instead of an empty session list; decide whether it should behave like a persistent default surface, a dismissible starter, or the same object as the control inbox
- [ ] Queued follow-up composer buffer — while a session is still streaming a reply, let the user stage another message in a buffer and auto-submit it as a fresh turn immediately after the active response finishes; external connectors like Feishu should share the same staged-turn contract and later define an interrupt/replace policy
- [ ] Session fork follow-ups — extend the shipped hard-clone head-fork with optional `Fork from here`, lightweight lineage navigation, and exact historical fork support when compaction-safe snapshots exist
- [ ] Broaden theming beyond system light/dark — keep v1 system-driven, then add optional explicit theme selection and more color palettes, preferably reusing VS Code-style open theme configs/tokens where that fits cleanly
- [ ] Post-LLM output processing (layered output: decision / summary / details)
- [ ] Revisit product naming/brand and possible repo rename after the product philosophy is more mature; treat this as intentionally deferred while the product itself is still taking shape
