# AGENTS.md — RemoteLab Project Context

> Canonical repo-local AI context lives here. Keep tool-specific files like `CLAUDE.md` only as thin compatibility shims that point back to this file.

> **Read this file first.** It gives you everything you need to work on this project without exploring blindly.
> For deep-dive topics, reference docs are linked at the bottom.

## What Is RemoteLab

A web app that lets users control AI coding tools (Claude Code, Codex) from a phone browser. The user is on mobile, the AI agent runs on their macOS/Linux machine.

**Not** a terminal emulator, IDE, or chatbot. It's a **control console for AI workers** — the user gives intent, the AI executes.

- Single owner, not multi-user
- Node.js, no external frameworks (only `ws` for WebSocket)
- Vanilla JS frontend, no build tools

## Architecture

```
Phone Browser ──HTTPS──→ Cloudflare Tunnel ──→ chat-server.mjs (:7690)
                                                    │
                                      HTTP control plane + WS hints
                                                    │
                                      durable history + run state
                                            │
                                 detached runners normalize back to HTTP
```

### Three-Service Architecture (permanent)

| Service | Port | Domain | Role |
|---------|------|--------|------|
| `chat-server.mjs` | **7690** | production chat domain | **Production** — stable, released |
| `chat-server.mjs` | **7692** | validation chat domain | **Test** — current development |
| `auth-proxy.mjs` | **7681** | emergency terminal domain | **Emergency terminal** — FROZEN, never modify |

**Dev workflow**: keep two chat-server planes active. Do all coding/conversation work on `7690`, do restart-heavy validation on `7692`, and only restart/reload `7690` after `7692` is verified.

**Self-hosting rule**: maintain two distinct chat-server roles. `7690` is the coding/operator plane where the live development conversation happens; `7692` is the validation plane for restart/test checks and should avoid active coding work. Prefer restarting the other plane, not the one carrying the current conversation. After `7692` looks good, finish the current thought on `7690`, then restart/reload `7690` if needed. Fall back to `7681` only for emergencies. Manual dev instances should use `scripts/chat-instance.sh`. Restarted in-flight turns are recoverable via the UI `Resume` flow when resume metadata was captured. See `notes/current/self-hosting-dev-restarts.md`.

### Data Storage

All runtime data lives in `~/.config/remotelab/`:

| File | Content |
|------|---------|
| `auth.json` | Access token + password hash |
| `chat-sessions.json` | All session metadata |
| `chat-history/` | Per-session event store (`meta.json`, `context.json`, `events/*.json`, `bodies/*.txt`) |
| `sidebar-state.json` | Progress tracking state |
| `apps.json` | App definitions (templates) |

## Key Product Concepts

### Sessions
Unit of work = one chat conversation with one AI tool. Persisted across disconnects. Resume IDs (`claudeSessionId`, `codexThreadId`) stored in metadata so AI context survives server restarts.

### Apps (Templates)
Reusable AI workflows shareable via link. Each App defines: name, systemPrompt, skills, tool. When a Visitor clicks the share link → auto-creates a scoped Session with the App's system prompt injected.

### Owner / Visitor Model
- **Owner**: Full access. Logs in with token or password.
- **Visitor**: Accesses only a specific App via share link. Sees chat-only UI (no sidebar). Each Visitor gets an independent Session. This is NOT multi-user — Visitors are scoped guests.

### Sidebar (Progress Tracking)
Shows all active sessions' status at a glance. Powered by `summarizer.mjs` — after each AI turn completes (`onExit`), a separate one-shot LLM call summarizes the session state into `sidebar-state.json`. The UI refreshes from HTTP reads plus WebSocket invalidation hints; there is no periodic polling in the main path.

### Memory System (Pointer-First)
- **Storage tiers** still matter:
  - System-level (`memory/system.md` in repo): universal learnings shared across deployments
  - User-level (`~/.remotelab/memory/`): machine-specific knowledge, private
- **Activation layers** matter just as much:
  - `bootstrap.md`: tiny startup index
  - `projects.md`: project pointer catalog
  - `tasks/` and deeper docs: load only after task scope is clear
- Goal: large total memory on disk, small relevant context in-session

---

## Security

- **Token**: 256-bit random hex, timing-safe comparison
- **Password**: scrypt-hashed alternative
- **Cookies**: HttpOnly + Secure + SameSite=Strict, 24h expiry
- **Rate limiting**: Exponential backoff on login failures (max 15min)
- **Network**: Services listen on 127.0.0.1 only; external access via Cloudflare Tunnel
- **CSP**: Nonce-based script allowlist
- **Input validation**: Tool commands reject shell metacharacters

---

## Hard Constraints (Non-Negotiable)

1. **Terminal service is FROZEN** — `auth-proxy.mjs`, `lib/router.mjs`, `lib/sessions.mjs`, `lib/proxy.mjs` must never be modified
2. **No external frameworks** — Node.js built-ins + `ws` only
3. **Three-service architecture** — always maintain production (7690) + test (7692) + emergency terminal (7681)
4. **Vanilla JS frontend** — no build tools, no framework
5. **Every change = new commit** — never use `--amend`, only new commits
6. **Single Owner** — no multi-user auth infrastructure
7. **Agent-driven first** — new features prefer conversation/Skill over dedicated UI
8. **ES Modules** — `"type": "module"`, all `.mjs` files
9. **Template style** — `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` substitution, nonce-injected scripts

## Current Priorities

### Done (recent)
- [x] Owner/Visitor dual-role identity
- [x] App system (CRUD API, share tokens, visitor flow)
- [x] Sidebar progress tracking (summarizer)
- [x] Resume ID persistence (survives server restarts)
- [x] Web push notifications

### P1 — Next Up
- [ ] Expose AI-controlled session presentation (`title`, `group`, `description`) via session APIs, then validate the AI-owned session UX and consolidate current project-session TODOs into one dedicated prioritization session
- [ ] Skills framework (file storage + loading mechanism)
- [ ] Provider registry abstraction — open model selection, local JS/JSON provider config, no more Claude/Codex-only model wiring
- [ ] Provider management UX — setup/settings should support preset enablement, simple GUI JSON providers, and advanced code mode
- [ ] Session metadata enrichment beyond presentation (`project`, `status`, `priority`, `tags`)

### P2 — Future
- [ ] Deferred triggers (AI-initiated actions, scheduled follow-ups)
- [ ] Session fork / hard-clone branching — copy a session into a brand-new isolated session with no shared resume/thread state so one good discussion can split into multiple independent follow-up threads; keep v1 lineage lightweight instead of adding a full tree UI immediately
- [ ] Post-LLM output processing (layered output: decision / summary / details)
- [ ] Revisit product naming/brand and possible repo rename after the product philosophy is more mature; treat this as intentionally deferred while the product itself is still taking shape
