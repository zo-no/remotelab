## What Is RemoteLab

A web app that lets users control AI coding tools (Claude Code, Codex) from a phone browser. The user is on mobile, the AI agent runs on their macOS/Linux machine.

**Not** a terminal emulator, IDE, or chatbot. It's a **control console for AI workers** — the user gives intent, the AI executes.

- Single owner, not multi-user
- Node.js, no external frameworks (only `ws` for WebSocket)
- Vanilla JS frontend, no build tools

## Architecture

```
Phone Browser ──HTTPS──→ Cloudflare Tunnel ──→ chat-server.mjs (:7690)
                                                    │
                                               WebSocket + HTTP API
                                                    │
                                            ┌───────┼───────┐
                                            ↓       ↓       ↓
                                     spawn claude  codex   (future tools)
                                            │
                                    parse output → stream events → frontend
```

### Three-Service Architecture (permanent)

| Service | Port | Domain | Role |
|---------|------|--------|------|
| `chat-server.mjs` | **7690** | `claude-v2.jiujianian-dev-world.win` | **Production** — stable, released |
| `chat-server.mjs` | **7692** | `ttest.jiujianian-dev-world.win` | **Test** — current development |
| `auth-proxy.mjs` | **7681** | `claude.jiujianian-dev-world.win` | **Emergency terminal** — FROZEN, never modify |

**Dev workflow**: keep two chat-server planes active. Do all coding/conversation work on `7690`, do restart-heavy validation on `7692`, and only restart/reload `7690` after `7692` is verified.

**Self-hosting rule**: maintain two distinct chat-server roles. `7690` is the coding/operator plane where the live development conversation happens; `7692` is the validation plane for restart/test checks and should avoid active coding work. Prefer restarting the other plane, not the one carrying the current conversation. After `7692` looks good, finish the current thought on `7690`, then restart/reload `7690` if needed. Fall back to `7681` only for emergencies. Manual dev instances should use `scripts/chat-instance.sh`. Restarted in-flight turns are recoverable via the UI `Resume` flow when resume metadata was captured. See `notes/self-hosting-dev-restarts.md`.

## Key Product Concepts

### Sessions
Unit of work = one chat conversation with one AI tool. Persisted across disconnects. Resume IDs (`claudeSessionId`, `codexThreadId`) stored in metadata so AI context survives server restarts.

### Apps (Templates)
Reusable AI workflows shareable via link. Each App defines: name, systemPrompt, skills, tool. When a Visitor clicks the share link → auto-creates a scoped Session with the App's system prompt injected.

### Owner / Visitor Model
- **Owner**: Full access. Logs in with token or password.
- **Visitor**: Accesses only a specific App via share link. Sees chat-only UI (no sidebar). Each Visitor gets an independent Session. This is NOT multi-user — Visitors are scoped guests.

### Sidebar (Progress Tracking)
Shows all active sessions' status at a glance. Powered by `summarizer.mjs` — after each AI turn completes (`onExit`), a separate one-shot LLM call summarizes the session state into `sidebar-state.json`. UI polls every 30s.

### Memory System (Pointer-First)
- **Storage tiers** still matter:
  - System-level (`memory/system.md` in repo): universal learnings shared across deployments
  - User-level (`~/.remotelab/memory/`): machine-specific knowledge, private
- **Activation layers** matter just as much:
  - `bootstrap.md`: tiny startup index
  - `projects.md`: project pointer catalog
  - `tasks/` and deeper docs: load only after task scope is clear
- Goal: large total memory on disk, small relevant context in-session

---

## Security

- **Token**: 256-bit random hex, timing-safe comparison
- **Password**: scrypt-hashed alternative
- **Cookies**: HttpOnly + Secure + SameSite=Strict, 24h expiry
- **Rate limiting**: Exponential backoff on login failures (max 15min)
- **Network**: Services listen on 127.0.0.1 only; external access via Cloudflare Tunnel
- **CSP**: Nonce-based script allowlist
- **Input validation**: Tool commands reject shell metacharacters

---

## Hard Constraints (Non-Negotiable)

1. **Terminal service is FROZEN** — `auth-proxy.mjs`, `lib/router.mjs`, `lib/sessions.mjs`, `lib/proxy.mjs` must never be modified
2. **No external frameworks** — Node.js built-ins + `ws` only
3. **Three-service architecture** — always maintain production (7690) + test (7692) + emergency terminal (7681)
4. **Vanilla JS frontend** — no build tools, no framework
5. **Every change = new commit** — never use `--amend`, only new commits
6. **Single Owner** — no multi-user auth infrastructure
7. **Agent-driven first** — new features prefer conversation/Skill over dedicated UI
8. **ES Modules** — `"type": "module"`, all `.mjs` files
9. **Template style** — `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` substitution, nonce-injected scripts

## Current Priorities

### Done (recent)
- [x] Owner/Visitor dual-role identity
- [x] App system (CRUD API, share tokens, visitor flow)
- [x] Sidebar progress tracking (summarizer)
- [x] Resume ID persistence (survives server restarts)
- [x] Web push notifications

### P1 — Next Up
- [ ] Visitor "new conversation" button (currently must re-click share link)
- [ ] Remove folder dependency — Agent defaults to home directory
- [ ] Skills framework (file storage + loading mechanism)
- [ ] Provider registry abstraction — open model selection, local JS/JSON provider config, no more Claude/Codex-only model wiring
- [ ] Provider management UX — setup/settings should support preset enablement, simple GUI JSON providers, and advanced code mode
- [ ] Session metadata enrichment (project, status, priority, tags)
- [ ] Session isolation for Apps — different App sessions should NOT see each other's chat history (privacy risk: cross-session history leakage)

### P2 — Future
- [ ] Deferred triggers (AI-initiated actions, scheduled follow-ups)
- [ ] Autonomous execution (background sessions, event-driven resumption)
- [ ] Post-LLM output processing (layered output: decision / summary / details)
