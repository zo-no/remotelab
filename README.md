# RemoteLab

[中文](README.zh.md) | English

Control AI coding tools (Claude Code, Codex, Cline) from your phone or any other device — no SSH, no VPN, just a browser.

> Release baseline: `v0.2` — the first product-shaped RemoteLab release after `v0.1`.

## For Humans

### What it does

RemoteLab runs a lightweight web server on your **Mac or Linux server**. You point a Cloudflare tunnel at it, get an HTTPS URL, and from any browser (phone, tablet, whatever) you can open a chat interface that talks to the AI tool running on your machine.

Your sessions persist across disconnects. History is kept on disk. Multiple sessions can run in parallel.

New sessions now start from `~` by default. For project-scoped work outside RemoteLab itself, tell the agent the repo path once and let it locate the relevant files.

After the first turn, RemoteLab can now let the agent assign a short session title, a one-level display group, and a hidden work description so the sidebar stays organized without turning groups back into real folders.

### Get set up in 5 minutes — hand it to an AI

The fastest way to set this up is to paste the following prompt into Claude Code on your Mac or Linux server. The AI handles everything automatically. The only thing it'll stop and ask you for is a browser login to Cloudflare (unavoidable — they need to confirm you own the domain).

**Prerequisites before you paste the prompt:**
- **macOS**: Homebrew installed + Node.js 18+
- **Linux**: Node.js 18+ + `dtach` + `ttyd` (the setup wizard can install these automatically)
- At least one AI tool installed (`claude`, `codex`, `cline`, …)
- A domain pointed at Cloudflare ([free account](https://cloudflare.com), domain ~$1–12/yr from Namecheap or Porkbun)

---

**Copy this prompt into Claude Code:**

```
I want to set up RemoteLab on this Mac so I can control AI coding tools from my phone.

My domain: [YOUR_DOMAIN]          (e.g. example.com)
Subdomain I want to use: [SUBDOMAIN]  (e.g. chat — will create chat.example.com)

Please follow the full setup guide at docs/setup.md in this repository.
Do every step you can automatically. When you hit a [HUMAN] step, stop and tell me exactly what to do.
After I confirm each manual step, continue to the next phase.
```

Fill in your domain and subdomain, paste it, and follow the AI's instructions. You'll click through one Cloudflare browser login. Everything else is automated.

### What you'll have when done

Open `https://[subdomain].[domain]/?token=YOUR_TOKEN` on your phone:

![Dashboard](docs/new-dashboard.png)

- Create a session: pick an AI tool — sessions start from `~` by default
- For non-RemoteLab projects, tell the agent the repo path once
- Let the agent auto-group related sessions in the sidebar without managing filesystem folders
- Send messages — the UI re-fetches canonical HTTP state while runs progress
- Close the browser, come back later — session is still alive
- Paste screenshots directly into the chat
- Share a read-only snapshot link of the current session without exposing any other sessions

Note: some screenshots/GIFs still show the older folder-picker flow during this transition. If you prefer that model, use [v0.1](https://github.com/Ninglo/remotelab/releases/tag/v0.1).

Validation scripts now live under `tests/` so the repo root stays focused on runtime entrypoints and docs.

### Daily usage

Once set up, the service auto-starts on boot (macOS LaunchAgent / Linux systemd). Just open the URL on your phone.

```
remotelab start          # start all services
remotelab stop           # stop all services
remotelab restart chat   # restart just the chat server
```

## Architecture

The default install runs two boot-managed services behind a Cloudflare tunnel. When self-hosting RemoteLab development, add a separate `7692` validation chat plane instead of turning it into another permanent boot service:

| Service | Port | Role |
|---------|------|------|
| `chat-server.mjs` | 7690 | **Primary.** HTTP control plane, detached runner supervisor, WS invalidation hints |
| `auth-proxy.mjs` | 7681 | **Fallback.** Raw terminal via ttyd — for emergencies only |
| `scripts/chat-instance.sh` → `chat-server.mjs` | 7692 | **Dev-only.** Disposable validation plane for restart-heavy checks |

The Cloudflare tunnel routes your domain to the primary chat server (7690). The auth-proxy is localhost-only — if chat breaks badly enough, you SSH in and hit it directly. The `7692` plane is for RemoteLab self-hosting development only and is normally started ad hoc via `scripts/chat-instance.sh`.

```
Phone ──HTTPS──→ Cloudflare Tunnel ──→ chat-server :7690
                                              │
                                        HTTP control plane
                                              │
                          durable event log + run state + detached runners
                                              │
                               browser reads via HTTP, `/ws` only hints refresh
```

### Session persistence

Session metadata, normalized history, and per-run state are persisted on disk. The browser renders from HTTP reads, so refresh/reconnect converges on the same canonical state without depending on transport continuity.

Active runs now execute in detached sidecars. If `chat-server` restarts mid-run, the control plane can come back, re-scan run output, and recover the final result. `Resume` remains available for explicitly interrupted legacy/manual cases when Claude/Codex resume metadata exists.

For self-hosting development, keep two chat-server planes active: use `7690` as the stable coding/operator plane and `7692` as the restartable validation plane. Avoid doing active coding work from `7692`; use it to verify changes, restart freely, and confirm behavior. Once `7692` is good, finish your current message on `7690` and only then restart/reload `7690` if needed. For custom-port dev instances, use `scripts/chat-instance.sh`.

For a top-down code map of the shipped system, see `docs/project-architecture.md`.

If you want to integrate email, GitHub, bots, or other external tools into the same session/message flow, see `docs/external-message-protocol.md`.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `CHAT_PORT` | `7690` | Chat server port |
| `LISTEN_PORT` | `7681` | Auth proxy port |
| `SESSION_EXPIRY` | `86400000` | Cookie lifetime in ms (24h) |

## File locations

| Path | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `~/.config/remotelab/auth.json` | Access token + password hash |
| `~/.config/remotelab/chat-sessions.json` | Chat session metadata |
| `~/.config/remotelab/chat-history/` | Per-session event store (`meta.json`, `context.json`, `events/*.json`, `bodies/*.txt`) |
| `~/.config/remotelab/shared-snapshots/` | Immutable read-only session share snapshots |
| `~/Library/Logs/chat-server.log` | Chat server stdout **(macOS)** |
| `~/.local/share/remotelab/logs/chat-server.log` | Chat server stdout **(Linux)** |
| `~/Library/Logs/cloudflared.log` | Tunnel stdout **(macOS)** |
| `~/.local/share/remotelab/logs/cloudflared.log` | Tunnel stdout **(Linux)** |

## Security

- HTTPS via Cloudflare (TLS at edge, Mac-side is localhost HTTP)
- 256-bit random access token, timing-safe comparison
- Optional scrypt-hashed password login
- HttpOnly + Secure + SameSite=Strict session cookies, 24h expiry
- Per-IP rate limiting with exponential backoff on failed login
- Mac server binds to 127.0.0.1 only — no direct external exposure
- CSP headers with nonce-based script allowlist

## Troubleshooting

**Service won't start (macOS):**
```bash
tail -50 ~/Library/Logs/chat-server.error.log
tail -50 ~/Library/Logs/auth-proxy.error.log
```

**Service won't start (Linux):**
```bash
journalctl --user -u remotelab-chat -n 50
tail -50 ~/.local/share/remotelab/logs/chat-server.error.log
```

**DNS not resolving:** Wait 5–30 minutes after setup. Verify: `dig SUBDOMAIN.DOMAIN +short`

**Port already in use:**
```bash
lsof -i :7690   # chat server
lsof -i :7681   # auth proxy
```

**Restart a single service:**
```bash
remotelab restart chat
remotelab restart proxy
remotelab restart tunnel
```

**Manage a custom dev chat instance:**
```bash
scripts/chat-instance.sh restart --port 7692 --name test
scripts/chat-instance.sh status --port 7692 --name test
scripts/chat-instance.sh logs --port 7692 --name test
```
