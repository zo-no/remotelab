# System-Level Memory — RemoteLab

Universal learnings and patterns that apply to all RemoteLab deployments, regardless of who runs it or on which machine. This file lives in the code repo and is shared with all users.

## What Belongs Here

- Cross-platform gotchas (macOS vs Linux differences)
- Common failure patterns and their root causes
- Effective prompt patterns and anti-patterns
- Best practices for tool orchestration (Claude Code, Codex, etc.)
- Architecture insights that reduce future debugging time

## Learnings

### Memory Bootstrap Hygiene (2026-03-06)
- Fresh or partially initialized RemoteLab setups may be missing `~/.remotelab/memory/skills.md`.
- If session startup expects that file, create a minimal placeholder index instead of treating the absence as a hard failure.

### Context Continuity Across Restarts (2026-03-06)
- Claude Code's `--resume <session_id>` flag is the ONLY mechanism for conversation continuity. Without it, every spawn starts a completely fresh session regardless of what the UI shows.
- Any in-memory state critical for continuity (session IDs, thread IDs) MUST be persisted to disk. In-memory Maps are wiped on process restart.
- The UI chat history (stored in JSON files) and the AI's actual context (controlled by `--resume`) are completely independent. Users will see old messages but the AI won't remember them — a confusing UX failure mode.
- Fix: persist `claudeSessionId`/`codexThreadId` in the session metadata JSON, rehydrate into memory when the session is first used after restart.
- **Rehydration ordering trap**: WebSocket `subscribe`/`attach` creates a bare `live` entry in the in-memory Map BEFORE `sendMessage` runs. If rehydration is gated on `!live`, it gets skipped. Rehydration must check the live entry's fields, not its existence.

### Testing Strategy for Self-Hosted Services (2026-03-06)
- Never restart the server you're running on to test restart-survival features. Spin up a separate instance on a different port (e.g., 7694) and run the full test cycle there.
- Use node WebSocket client for API testing — match the actual protocol (`action` field, attach-before-send flow).

### Project Path Persistence (2026-03-06)
- When a user has already confirmed a repo path for an active task, persist that path immediately into user-level memory or a task note.
- On later turns, check memory before doing broad filesystem searches; repeated rediscovery wastes time and breaks continuity.

### Tool Selection State Must Be Split (2026-03-06)
- If the UI supports switching tools mid-session (e.g. Claude → Codex), the session metadata on disk MUST be updated when the switch happens. Otherwise reload/reattach paths snap the selector back to the stale `session.tool`.
- The active session tool and the user's default tool preference are different states. Reusing one variable for both causes "it keeps forgetting my default" bugs whenever the user opens an older session.

### Codex Home Directory Trust Check (2026-03-06)
- `codex exec` can hard-fail with `Not inside a trusted directory and --skip-git-repo-check was not specified.` when `cwd` is the user's home directory, even if approvals/sandbox are already bypassed.
- In RemoteLab, this presents as a "silent" or "no response" Codex session because the process exits before emitting JSON events; Claude does not have this constraint, so the mismatch looks path-specific.
- If the product intentionally launches agents from `~` or other non-repo roots, pass `--skip-git-repo-check` in the Codex adapter (or explicitly trust that directory in Codex config).

### KYC / Account Registration Requests (2026-03-06)
- If a user asks for a "public address" or advice on what address/location to enter for account opening, treat it as potential misrepresentation/compliance evasion.
- Do not help source placeholder/fake addresses or craft deceptive explanations.
- Safe fallback: explain legitimate reasons residence and phone region can differ, suggest truthful disclosure, and provide a concise compliance-safe explanation template.

### Provider Abstractions Must Own Runtime + Models (2026-03-06)
- If command discovery, model catalogs, reasoning controls, and runtime spawning live in separate hardcoded switches, "custom tool" support becomes fake: the dropdown works, but model selection and execution do not.
- RemoteLab should treat a provider as the single source of truth for command availability, model catalog, reasoning schema, runtime adapter, and resume key.
- Use the same provider contract for two extension paths: local static JSON for hardcoded catalogs, and JS modules for dynamic probing / PR-worthy integrations.

### Provider Extensibility Works Best as Preset + Form + Code (2026-03-06)
- Pure code-only plugin systems discourage casual contributions; pure GUI forms cannot express custom parsers or dynamic probing.
- A good provider ecosystem has three layers: builtin presets, GUI-authored local JSON providers, and advanced JS providers.
- To keep the GUI itself extensible, runtime families should expose a declarative authoring schema that the frontend renders, instead of hardcoding separate forms for each provider.
- As a lightweight bridge, adding a synthetic `+ Add more...` action to the existing tool picker is enough to teach extensibility early, without waiting for a full provider-management page.
- Background one-shot model calls (for example session auto-naming or sidebar summarization) must reuse the triggering turn's provider/model/reasoning config. Hardcoding those paths to Claude creates hidden availability bugs on Codex-only installs.
- Claude Code and Codex do NOT emit the same raw JSON protocol, but both can be normalized into the same internal event stream. The parser boundary should therefore be runtime-family-specific, while the UI/session layer consumes the normalized events.

### Cross-Provider Session Continuity Needs A History Handoff (2026-03-06)
- Provider-native resume IDs (`claudeSessionId`, `codexThreadId`) preserve context only within the same runtime family; clearing them on tool switch without another handoff silently drops the session's prior context.
- Once providers already normalize their raw output into a shared event history, the first turn of any fresh provider thread should inject a transcript reconstructed from that normalized history.
- Build the handoff from user/assistant messages plus salient tool calls/results/file changes, not raw provider JSON and not prior reasoning traces.
- Exclude the just-sent user message from the reconstructed transcript, or the new provider sees that message twice.

### Private Cross-Device Context Needs Its Own Layer (2026-03-06)
- A simple split between repo-shared memory and machine-local memory breaks down when the same user runs RemoteLab on multiple computers.
- Keep universal prompt/memory in the repo, keep machine facts local, and maintain a separate private portable layer for user-specific but cross-device principles.
- The portable layer should contain stable collaboration preferences and execution principles, not local paths, ports, logs, launchd/systemd details, or secrets.
- Reliable bootstrap flow: install RemoteLab first, then import the portable layer into `~/.remotelab/memory/global.md` as a synced block, and let each machine maintain its own local notes around that block.
- For ongoing multi-machine use, sync the portable layer through its own git repo; do not sync the whole machine-memory directory.
- A public repo is only appropriate if the portable layer is intentionally curated as publishable and is audited for machine-local or secret-like content before push.
- If the sync repo is private, include bootstrap/helper scripts in the repo as well so a newly provisioned machine can clone once and self-bootstrap without relying on an out-of-band bundle.
- Bootstrap flows for active development should pin an explicit source branch when the desired code is ahead of the repo's default branch; otherwise fresh machines silently install stale code.
- When a user says another machine should "just use the latest updates," verify whether those commits only live on a feature branch; either fast-forward the default branch or communicate the exact branch to pull.
- Any constraint that must apply from the very first assistant turn (for example output language or branch selection) must be stated in the bootstrap handoff prompt itself, not only in memory that gets imported later.

### Browser-Only Frontend Validation Without A Test Harness (2026-03-06)
- For `static/*.js` browser IIFEs that hide internal functions, a low-friction regression check is: load the real source into a temporary `jsdom`, patch the final `})();` in-memory to expose the target functions, and exercise them against a minimal DOM fixture.
- This validates the actual shipped file and DOM mutations without adding permanent test dependencies or modifying the repo.

### `nettop` Byte Logging Requires CSV Mode (2026-03-06)
- On macOS, `nettop -P -x -k bytes_in,bytes_out` does NOT give a bytes-only table; it can still emit the default columns, which makes any parser silently wrong.
- For machine-readable per-process byte counters, use `nettop -P -x -L 1 -J bytes_in,bytes_out -n` and parse the CSV output.
- If you need interval deltas instead of cumulative counters, add `-d` and capture the second sample from `-L 2`.

### End-to-End AI Workflows Usually Break At Input Sprawl, Not Model Quality (2026-03-06)
- Once an AI workflow already runs end-to-end, the next bottleneck is often scattered inputs across files, env vars, chat instructions, and operator memory rather than raw model capability.
- Before adding UI or broader feature surface, unify the workflow into a single job contract / manifest so prompts, CLIs, artifacts, and review all read the same source of truth.
- A good smell test: if each run still requires re-explaining goals, policy, or runtime assumptions in chat, the workflow is not productized yet.

### Auto-Renamed Titles Need An Explicit Pending Flag (2026-03-06)
- If a session title can pass through multiple automatic states (for example default placeholder → first-message draft → model-generated summary title), do not key rename eligibility off the visible name alone.
- Persist an explicit boolean like `autoRenamePending`; otherwise a temporary draft title blocks the later AI rename, and a late AI callback can overwrite a user's manual rename.
- The rename callback itself should re-check that pending flag at execution time, not just when the background summary job started.

### Active Session Restore Should Share One Deep-Link Contract (2026-03-06)
- Refresh restore, sidebar tab restore, and notification-open behavior should not each pick their own session separately; drive all three from the same `session`/`tab` deep-link contract plus one persisted local fallback.
- Good precedence is: explicit notification/URL target first, then last locally active session, then most recently updated session.
- Push notifications should carry the target session URL in their payload, and existing app windows should receive an in-page message to switch sessions without a forced reload. Fresh windows can fall back to `openWindow(url)`.
- To make "latest session" meaningful, persist a session-level recency field like `updatedAt` and sort session listings/fallback selection by it.

### Open Local Config Should Fail Per Record, Not Per File (2026-03-06)
- Once provider/tool extensibility relies on user-editable local JSON, a single bad record must be skipped with a clear log instead of breaking the entire picker/API response.
- Treat malformed config files and unsupported provider fields as operator mistakes to isolate, not reasons to take down unrelated valid tools.
- If quick-add stays lightweight, document its compatibility boundary explicitly in the UI: family-compatible CLIs can be saved live; anything with custom flag semantics should take the advanced path.

### Owner / Visitor Splits Must Be Enforced Per Route (2026-03-06)
- In RemoteLab, "authenticated" is not a sufficient authorization boundary once share-link visitors exist; a visitor session cookie is still a valid authenticated session.
- Every HTTP route and WebSocket action must explicitly decide whether it is owner-only, visitor-scoped, or public. Relying on UI hiding or a generic `requireAuth` check lets share-link visitors reach owner surfaces.
- High-risk examples are session CRUD/listing, filesystem browse/autocomplete, global settings/sidebar state, and push-subscription endpoints; those leak host metadata or allow state changes even when visitors cannot fully attach to owner sessions over WebSocket.
- A safe regression pattern is to boot the server under a temporary `HOME` with `SECURE_COOKIES=0` on an isolated port, create both owner and visitor cookies, and verify each route class with `curl`/WebSocket probes without touching the live config.

### Share-Link Visitor State Must Come From Auth, Not URL (2026-03-06)
- A one-time `/?visitor=1` redirect is only a bootstrap hint. After the frontend cleans that query param, refreshes still carry the visitor cookie but no longer carry the URL marker.
- If the UI only checks the URL to decide visitor mode, a refresh silently falls back into owner-style initialization and immediately calls owner-only APIs.
- Reliable pattern: query `/api/auth/me` on every page load, derive mode from the authenticated role, and then decide whether to load owner-only surfaces like tools, models, settings, sidebar state, or push registration.

### Hidden Markdown Blocks Work Best As Parser Extensions (2026-03-06)
- For `marked`, custom block + inline extensions are a clean way to consume tags like `<private>...</private>` and `<hide>...</hide>` so the UI hides them while the raw message text stays intact for history and model context.
- After rendering, skip empty assistant bubbles; otherwise a response that only contains hidden blocks still leaves blank UI chrome behind.

### Private Skill Knowledge Stays Out Of Shared Memory (2026-03-06)
- Repo-shared system memory must not store operational notes for private or org-specific skills/integrations, even if the pattern feels broadly useful inside one company's environment.
- Put that knowledge in the skill's own docs when the skill is private/local, or in user-level memory on the relevant machine if it is an operator-specific workaround.
- Reserve shared system memory for truths that still help a generic RemoteLab deployment with no access to the private skill at all.

### Always-On Memory Should Be Tiny And Ranked (2026-03-06)
- If hard rules, user preferences, long memory notes, skill catalogs, and operator guidance are all injected at session start, important constraints lose salience and the model falls back to generic heuristics.
- Split context into tiers: a tiny always-on contract for non-negotiables, a short session note for the active task, a lightweight capability index, and on-demand retrieval for detailed memory/skill docs.
- Prefer promoting only durable constraints into always-on context; demote examples, edge cases, long explanations, and rare workflows into indexed reference material.

### Task Scope Must Gate Memory Retrieval (2026-03-06)
- Do not preload unrelated project/task memory for generic conversations just because those files exist on disk.
- Memory retrieval should follow a gated flow: bootstrap contract first, then identify/confirm the current task scope, then load only the matching task notes, skills, and domain docs.
- Project-specific notes are retrieval candidates, not mandatory startup context. For example, an `intelligent-app` task note should stay out of a general conversation unless the user clearly moves into that task.
- A startup rule like "read all memory files at the start of every session" is an architectural mismatch if the product goal is focus and bounded context; it turns retrieval into unconditional preload.

### Memory Writeback Must Be Sparse And Pruned (2026-03-06)
- Reflection is valuable, but memory writes should be rare and selective. Persist only durable lessons with clear expected reuse.
- Prefer editing, merging, or deleting existing memory instead of appending near-duplicate notes.
- Memory hygiene should happen on a light cadence: daily during intense debugging or weekly otherwise.
- Archive or trim stale task notes once they stop improving future execution.

### Boot Memory Should Stay Pointer-Sized (2026-03-06)
- In RemoteLab, the built-in boot prompt should stay a small pointer/index that tells the agent which memory files exist; do not inline full memory documents there.
- Default context bloat usually comes from the agent explicitly reading large memory files and from accumulated chat/tool history, not from `buildSystemContext()` itself.
- Practical rule: keep bootstrap memory tiny, split large notes into topical files, and read deep context on demand instead of every session.

### Existing RemoteLab Push State Can Power One-Off Reminders (2026-03-06)
- If a deployment already has active web-push subscriptions, you can send ad hoc reminders without touching app code by reading `~/.config/remotelab/vapid-keys.json` and `~/.config/remotelab/push-subscriptions.json` from a local script and using the repo's `web-push` dependency directly.
- This is useful for operator-scheduled reminders or out-of-band alerts, but it still depends on the host machine being awake and online at send time; pair it with a local fallback notification and, when appropriate, temporary `caffeinate`.

### Public Snapshot Shares Should Be Static + Sandboxed (2026-03-06)
- For one-link public transcript sharing, generate an immutable snapshot from the current session history instead of attaching visitors to any live session or auth state.
- Serve the snapshot as its own read-only page with embedded snapshot data, not the normal chat app bootstrap, so there is no sidebar, websocket, or send path to accidentally expose.
- Tighten the share page boundary with `connect-src 'none'`, `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`, and `X-Robots-Tag: noindex, nofollow, noarchive`.
- When rendering shared markdown, strip raw HTML and same-origin relative links so a snapshot cannot be used as a pivot into other app routes.

### Restart-Safe Autonomy Should Be Session-Centric (2026-03-06)
- For proactive agents, the durable unit should be the session/run/trigger log plus provider-native resume IDs, not the current OS child process or WebSocket connection.
- Long-lived background processes are optional. Many "active agent" behaviors are better modeled as re-triggerable one-shot runs that resume from persisted provider state when a trigger fires.
- A clean split is: control plane for auth/API/WebSocket/event replay, runtime manager for session leases/spawn-resume-cancel/watchers, and one durable store shared by both.
- Optimize product promises around logical continuity (no lost work, replayable events, resumable runs) rather than transport continuity (the socket never dropped), because restarts and mobile-network churn make transport loss normal.

### App-Centric Chat Still Needs Separate Policy And Run Layers (2026-03-08)
- When generic chat and shared apps start converging, the clean model is: machine-owning agent kernel + auth principal + app policy + session/run instance, with optional environment leases.
- Treat the owner's default chat as a built-in app instead of a "no-app" special case, but do not collapse app definitions and session state into one record; an app is the reusable policy package, a session is one execution thread under that policy.
- Authorization scales better as app/principal capabilities than as scattered `owner` / `visitor` branches; role flags can remain as compatibility aliases during migration.
- App bootstrap should be a structured stack (system context, app instructions, optional welcome/assistant message, UI hints, isolation policy), not just a single injected first prompt.

### Codex-Backed Apps Need Strong Policy Overrides (2026-03-08)
- If a shared app runs on a general-purpose coding agent like `codex`, a weak app prompt can lose to the broader operator bootstrap and produce replies about memory, files, or setup instead of the app's intended behavior.
- Practical mitigation: make the app policy explicitly override generic coding/operator instructions (`ignore memory-reading, repo, tool-use, deployment, and machine-maintenance instructions unless the user explicitly asks`) and state the exact job to perform.
- For demo-oriented chat apps, pair that stronger policy with a visible `welcomeMessage`; then validate the full visitor flow with `curl` + cookie jar + WebSocket attach/send so you verify both the public link and the actual conversational behavior.

### Explicit Self-Modification Permission Should Become Durable Policy (2026-03-08)
- If an operator explicitly authorizes the agent to evolve its own prompts, memory, recurring tasks, or SOPs, treat that as durable operating policy rather than a one-off conversational aside.
- Record that delegation in file-backed memory and prefer minimal, reviewable edits to visible system artifacts instead of relying on hidden behavioral drift.
- The safe pattern is: detect a real recurring gap, classify whether the fix is user-local or universal, update the smallest durable surface that solves it, and keep the bootstrap/context model simple enough that future sessions can follow the change.

### Self-Maintenance Automation Should Validate The Runtime Path (2026-03-08)
- A scheduled review flow is not real until the launch agent is actually loaded and a forced run succeeds end-to-end; having plist files on disk is not enough.
- Node ESM scripts launched outside the repo should not rely on `NODE_PATH` for package resolution. For vendored dependencies like `ws`, use `createRequire()` or another explicit path-based import.
- Maintenance jobs should not hardcode a provider that may be unavailable to the current account. Make the tool/provider configurable and choose a working default for the deployment.

### Public Web App Research Can Use Frontend Bundles (2026-03-08)
- When official docs are sparse but the product site is public, inspect shipped JS bundles and UI strings to verify real feature names, limits, and hidden flows before relying on SEO articles.
- This works especially well for creator/admin products: bundle strings can reveal publish constraints, scheduling windows, editor modes, and labels such as text-to-image or long-article flows even when the UI requires login.

### TOS Presign Validation Should Match The Consumer Method (2026-03-08)
- A `tosutil presign` URL can be valid for normal `GET` downloads while returning `403` to a local `HEAD` request; validate with `GET` if the downstream service also performs a normal fetch.

### Review Drafts Should Not Mark Every Micro-Cut (2026-03-08)
- In transcript-driven video rough-cut workflows, a "kept content" review draft becomes unreadable if every same-utterance stutter trim is rendered as an explicit join marker.
- A better default is to merge same-utterance micro-cuts into continuous prose and reserve visible `→ ✂️ →` markers for larger semantic joins, such as skipped whole utterances or section-level jumps.
- Keep the fully annotated raw transcript as the safety net; let the kept-content draft optimize for readability and flow judgment.

### Preference Slips Should Be Framed As Execution Failures, Not Memory Loss (2026-03-08)
- When a user flags that a standing preference was broken, verify the memory record first and explicitly tell them whether the preference is still stored.
- If the preference is present, describe the issue as a failure to follow stored instructions, apologize clearly, and restate the standing default so trust is repaired with evidence instead of vague reassurance.
