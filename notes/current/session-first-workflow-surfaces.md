# Session-First Workflow Surfaces

> Status: current baseline.
> Purpose: freeze the organization model for session list / board / group / task-like workflow views so RemoteLab does not drift into parallel domain objects before they are truly needed.

## Core Decision

For the current RemoteLab architecture:

> `Session` is the only durable work object.

Everything the owner sees in workflow organization should be one of two things:

- canonical metadata attached to a session
- a derived UI projection over sessions

That means the current system does **not** have separate canonical objects for:

- `Board`
- `Task`
- `BoardCard`
- `ProgressItem`
- `Group`

Those are product surfaces, not independent storage authorities.

## Current Product-Shape Rule

For the current discovery phase:

- Do not let the shipped `Board` implementation define the main product shape while the owner interaction is still being discovered.
- It is acceptable to hide or remove the current board temporarily if that helps the team think more clearly about the ideal session-first flow.
- If `Board` returns later, it should return as a derived projection over sessions, not as the object that justifies the workflow model.

---

## What Belongs On The Session Today

The current session-first workflow model is intentionally lightweight.

Durable session metadata may include fields such as:

- `name`
- `group`
- `description`
- `workflowState`
- `workflowPriority`
- `lastReviewedAt`
- `pinned`
- app/source association fields when relevant

Live execution state is still separate and should remain separate:

- active run lifecycle
- queued follow-ups
- rename / compaction activity

The board should read those session-level signals. It should not invent a second durable “task status” object.

---

## What The Current Board Is

The current board is a projection over sessions.

In practical terms:

- columns are derived from live session activity plus `workflowState`
- priority pills are derived from `workflowPriority` with sensible fallback from `workflowState`
- card ordering is derived from priority, pinning, and recency
- board cards point back to the underlying session
- the session list and the board are two views over the same canonical objects

So the correct mental model is:

```text
Board = session workflow view
Session list = session compact view
```

Not:

```text
Board = separate task system that happens to link to sessions
```

---

## How To Think About `group`

`group` is currently a lightweight session metadata field.

It is useful for:

- visual grouping in the sidebar
- lightweight project/domain clustering
- helping the model generate a stable label for related work

It is **not** currently:

- a first-class parent entity
- a permissions boundary
- a durable container with its own lifecycle
- a place where independent board logic should live

So the right current reading is:

```text
group = a session facet, not a new object
```

---

## How To Think About `task`

People can absolutely talk about “tasks” in product language.

But under the current architecture, a “task” should usually collapse into one of these:

- the session itself when the work is one durable thread
- the session title / description when the work only needs labeling
- `workflowState` / `workflowPriority` when the work only needs board organization
- future cross-session structure only when one real unit of work outgrows a single session

So unless something has its own identity and lifecycle independent from a session, do **not** persist it as a separate task object.

---

## Architectural Rules

When adding workflow-management features, prefer these rules in order:

1. Attach durable presentation/workflow metadata to `Session` first.
2. Derive board/list/filter views from sessions second.
3. Only introduce a new object if session metadata can no longer express the product honestly.

Three hard constraints should hold:

1. The board must not own truth that the session does not.
2. The frontend must not silently invent a second authoritative workflow model.
3. The backend must not maintain a separate task-board store unless the product intentionally grows a new canonical object.

---

## When A Second Layer Becomes Legitimate

It is reasonable that RemoteLab may eventually need something above sessions.

But that should happen only when the product has a real need for a cross-session work object, for example when one unit of work needs:

- multiple sessions over time
- a stable identity independent from any single session
- its own summary / status / archival semantics
- cross-session notes, attachments, or checkpoints
- navigation that should survive session splits, forks, or rewrites

If that day comes, the right move is:

```text
Workstream/Case/Project (new object)
  -> many Sessions
    -> many Runs
```

Not:

```text
BoardCard/Task becomes the hidden real object
and Session becomes a chat attachment hanging off it
```

In other words: if RemoteLab grows a second layer, it should be an explicit parent above sessions, not a shadow board entity beside sessions.

---

## Practical Product Guidance

For current feature work, these defaults should hold:

- if the owner wants a better board, improve session metadata and board derivation first
- if the owner wants better recall after many delegated conversations, improve session naming / grouping / descriptions / summaries first
- if the owner wants easier attention management, improve workflow projection first
- if a proposal needs its own object, ask whether it truly survives beyond any one session

This keeps RemoteLab aligned with its core product identity:

> durable AI work is centered on sessions, and workflow organization is built around them rather than replacing them.
