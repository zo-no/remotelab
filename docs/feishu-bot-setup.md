# Feishu Bot Setup Contract (Prompt-First)

This document is the rollout contract for asking an AI agent on the RemoteLab machine to wire a Feishu connector.

The human should mostly stay in one conversation with that agent, hand over the needed context in one concentrated round, and only leave the chat for explicit `[HUMAN]` console or client steps.

## Copy this prompt

```text
I want you to set up a RemoteLab-backed Feishu bot on this machine.

Follow `docs/feishu-bot-setup.md` in this repository as the setup contract.
Keep the workflow inside this chat.
Before doing work, collect every missing input in one message so I can answer once.
Do every automatable step yourself.
After my reply, continue autonomously and only stop for true `[HUMAN]` steps or final completion.
When you stop, tell me exactly what I need to click or send, and how you'll verify the next state afterward.
```

## Outcome

By the end of this flow you should have:

- one self-built Feishu app bot
- one subscribed inbound event: `im.message.receive_v1`
- one local `feishu-connector` using persistent connection
- one working private-chat validation path
- RemoteLab sessions created or reused behind the bot

This rollout stays intentionally narrow at first:

- self-built app bot, not a custom group webhook bot
- same-tenant rollout first, not cross-tenant distribution
- private chat first, group support later
- persistent connection / long connection, not public webhook mode
- V0 reply handling is text-first; non-text Feishu payloads such as images, files, and rich posts are logged and marked handled, but ignored without reply

## One-round input handoff

The AI should try to confirm the whole packet below in one early exchange.

- region: `feishu-cn` for `open.feishu.cn` or `lark-global` for `open.larksuite.com`
- the first validation user is in the same Feishu tenant as the app
- which RemoteLab session tool should back the bot by default
- whether V0 should start with `allow_all` or `whitelist`

If the app does not exist yet, the AI should tell the human in one pass which console outputs it will need back later, rather than asking for them one at a time.

## [HUMAN] steps

1. Create a self-built Feishu app.
2. Enable the app's bot capability.
3. Open the minimum IM read and send permissions needed for private chat.
4. Subscribe only `im.message.receive_v1` under Tenant Token-Based Subscription.
5. Choose persistent connection / long connection as the inbound mode.
6. Add the first tester to app availability scope and publish or apply the current version.
7. Send the AI this handoff payload:

```text
Feishu bot setup ready.

App ID: ...
App Secret: ...
Region: Feishu CN / Lark Global
Subscribed event: im.message.receive_v1
My user is in app availability scope: yes / no
I can already search the bot in Feishu: yes / no
```

8. After the AI reports the connector is online, send a private test message to the bot.

Prefer one Feishu-console visit that covers app creation, permissions, event subscription, persistent connection mode, availability scope, and publish/apply before returning to the AI.

## Important human-side notes

- Start with same-tenant private chat; do not start with cross-tenant distribution.
- If the console warns `No connection detected`, let the AI bring the connector online first, then return and save persistent connection mode again.
- If outbound later fails with Feishu error `99991672`, enable the exact IM send permission named in the error message.
- If you want the bot to add a quick “I’m looking” reaction before the real reply lands, also enable `发送、删除消息表情回复 (im:message.reactions:write_only)`.

## AI execution contract

- ensure the RemoteLab chat server is running at `http://127.0.0.1:7690`
- front-load all missing context and expected return payloads so the human can finish the console work in as few interruptions as possible
- create `~/.config/remotelab/feishu-connector/config.json`
- use `npm run feishu:ops -- restart` to start or restart the connector without spawning a duplicate local instance when `launchd` is already managing it
- use `npm run feishu:check -- --watch 15` and the connector logs to validate inbound and outbound behavior
- keep the rollout inside this conversation; when a console fix is required, pause with a precise `[HUMAN]` instruction
- if V0 succeeds, optionally suggest widening availability or switching from `allow_all` to `whitelist`

## Fast operator commands

Use the built-in ops wrapper when you need a short, repeatable troubleshooting loop instead of ad-hoc shell steps.

```bash
npm run feishu:ops -- status
npm run feishu:ops -- restart
npm run feishu:ops -- backfill --count 2 --tool micro-agent --model gpt-5.4 --effort low
```

Notes:

- `status` shows the active runtime, whether the connector process is up, the latest inbound event, and recent text messages that were recorded as `silent_no_reply`
- `restart` prefers the installed `launchd` agent when present and otherwise falls back to the local instance script
- `backfill` creates a fresh reply session and drafts a catch-up reply for recent silent text messages; add `--dry-run` to inspect the target and prompt without sending
- if `backfill` fails with `Bot/User can NOT be out of the chat`, the bot is no longer in that chat, so the draft exists but Feishu will refuse delivery until the bot is added back

## Config contract

```json
{
  "appId": "cli_xxx",
  "appSecret": "replace-with-real-secret",
  "region": "feishu-cn",
  "loggerLevel": "info",
  "chatBaseUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:7690",
  "sessionTool": "codex",
  "processingReaction": {
    "enabled": true,
    "emojiType": "THINKING",
    "removeOnCompletion": false
  },
  "silentConfirmationText": "",
  "intakePolicy": {
    "mode": "allow_all"
  }
}
```

Notes:

- use `feishu-cn` for `open.feishu.cn`
- use `lark-global` for `open.larksuite.com`
- omit `sessionFolder` to use the operator's home directory by default
- `processingReaction` lets the bot add a quick reaction on the user's message before the real reply lands; by default it uses `THINKING` and keeps it attached as a lightweight ack marker
- `emojiType` must be one of Feishu's reaction emoji types such as `THINKING`, `WRONGED`, `FINGERHEART`, `GLANCE`, or `SMILE`; if you specifically want the built-in `委屈`-style reaction, use `WRONGED` rather than `HURT`
- `silentConfirmationText` lets the connector send a tiny text acknowledgement when the assistant would otherwise stay silent; this is useful for Feishu-style emoticon tokens like `[委屈]`
- set `removeOnCompletion` to `true` only if you want the reaction to be temporary and disappear after the reply lands
- the connector forwards mostly the rendered user message plus mention-token hints, not a large blob of transport metadata
- `allow_all` is the simplest V0 mode; move to `whitelist` after the first validation if needed

## Success state

- the connector log contains `persistent connection ready`
- the tester can search the bot and open a private chat
- an inbound message reaches RemoteLab
- RemoteLab creates or reuses the matching session
- the bot sends a reply back into Feishu

## After V0

- widen the same-tenant availability scope
- validate searchability for another coworker
- add group support only after private chat is stable
- treat cross-tenant distribution as a later marketplace or distributable-app phase
