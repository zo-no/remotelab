# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Adds a first owner-facing `Board` sidebar tab that reuses sessions as the only durable object while presenting kanban-style workflow columns.
- Persists lightweight session `workflowState` metadata (`parked`, `waiting_user`, `done`) and derives `Running` from live runtime activity instead of duplicating run truth.
- Triggers a post-turn AI classifier to refresh each session's board position after normal assistant turns complete.

## v0.3.1

- Fixes mobile keyboard layout so the shell behaves as stable header + content + composer rows.
- Removes a mobile horizontal overflow regression caused by a stale fixed negative margin on the composer resize handle.
- Keeps viewport-driven layout ownership centralized to reduce resize conflicts and future mobile compatibility risk.

## v0.3.0

- Adds a clearer user-facing `Ver x.y.z` build label while keeping commit and frontend fingerprint data available for debugging.
- Splits frontend/page version identity from backend/service identity so the UI reports the code actually on screen.
- Switches frontend freshness detection from timer polling to push-only WebSocket invalidation.

## v0.2.0

- Consolidates the repo around the current HTTP-first RemoteLab architecture.
- Treats the current product shape as the new stable baseline after `v0.1`.
- Adds stronger session organization, restart recovery, sharing, and external channel work.
- Moves scenario-style validation scripts into `tests/` to keep the repo root cleaner.
- Templates Cloudflare email-worker config so personal deployment values do not need to ship in git.
